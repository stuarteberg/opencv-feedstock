  patches:
    - osx_rpath.patch  # [osx]

build:
  # Note:
  # The version of build '2' on anaconda.org/flyem-forge was generated by copying the 
  # tarball for build 1 and simply correcting the jpeg requirement and updating the build number.
  # I didn't want to waste my time by actually recompiling OpenCV.
  # I also relaxed the version requirements for zlib, since 1.2.11 seems to be backwards compatible with 1.2.8

    - zlib >=1.2.8,<=1.2.11

    - jpeg >=9b,<10a0 # Note: '9*' is not sufficient any more.
                      # Conda now considers '9*' to mean "9 <= x < 10",
                      # but '9a' and '9b' are treated as 'alpha' and 'beta' versions, and therefore < 9.0
